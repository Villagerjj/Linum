    "description": "Linum currently is a simple platformer demo with fluid animation that is written in C. I plan on making it into a fighting and platforming type of game with even more optimized animation. Linum's future also will have support for the link cable for CO-OP and PVP. you will also be able to take snapshots and print them out with the gameboy printer. Linum will be a simple yet stunning game. And i am the only developer.",
